Want to contribute?

First off, read and submit:

  * http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html

I'm not a lawyer, but it basically says you're letting Google use your open source code.  You still own the copyright to it, but Google can use it.  For an open source license (as this is) that's pretty much what you'd already expect.  In any case, you should read the license text yourself and only submit it if you're cool with it.

Next, read Brad's general committing rules:

  * http://danga.com/commit.bml

If you're cool with that, ignore the htpasswd instructions and instead email brad@danga.com  your Google account email address (whatever you log into code.google.com with) and let me know which svn repo(s) you want to commit to (perl-appengine, sys-protect, protobuf-perl, etc).  You might have to mail your patches to the mailing list first for awhile until you're "invited" to this wiki page to follow these instructions.  That's typical.  But even after that, you're still expected to use http://codereview.appspot.com/ or patches mailed to lists before you do crazy stuff in trunk.  Getting a commit bit doesn't imply free will to commit whatever ignoring the community.  Please continue to interact with the lists even once you're a committer... it lets other people track what's going on.
