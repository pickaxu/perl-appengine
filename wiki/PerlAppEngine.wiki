# This page has the plan for getting Perl supported on Google AppEngine

= Introduction =

This is the current (initial) plan for how to get Perl supported on AppEngine.

= Work Outline =

In some sense, we should imitate Google's Python code base, which you can see here.

  http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

You can check out the sources to your local system this way.

  svn checkout http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ google-appengine

The major tasks seem to be:

  # Make Perl "safe" for the App Engine cloud.
    # This might be done using Safe.pm so Perl can't do things that are [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/sandbox.html not allowed in the cloud] such as attempting to open a socket, write to a file, or do dynamic linking.
    # Code that performs these illegal actions must raise an error.
    # This might also include changes to the Perl build system to easily enable the creation of a suitable executable which links necessary XS modules statically and disallows dynamic linking. It might need to turn off certain support at compile time rather than depending on Safe.pm.
    # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
    # The community could do this, without help from the Google App Engine team.
  # Write the public version of the Google API's (i.e. base classes that define the API which need to be subclassed in order to achieve the desired functionality)
    # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
    # The community could do this, without help from the Google App Engine team.
  # Write the Development Kit with a built-in web server
    # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
    # The community could do this, without help from the Google App Engine team.
  # Write the Development Kit "container" (i.e. the glue code which routes requests arriving at the web server to the perl interpreter and back.)
    # This would also include the low-level implementations of the public base classes which implement work-alike functionality to the Datastore, Mail, Images, Memcache, URL Fetch, and Users libraries provided by Google.
    # Writing this container would result in the recommended list of Perl modules to be included by default in the Google App Engine implementation along with the core Perl modules.
    # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
    # The community could do this, without help from the Google App Engine team.
  # Determine what would be the recommended list of Perl modules to be included by default in the Google App Engine implementation along with the core Perl modules.
    # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
    # The community could do this, without help from the Google App Engine team.
  # Write the Google App Engine "container" (i.e. the glue code which routes requests arriving at the web server to the perl interpreter and back.)
    # This would also include the low-level implementations of the public base classes
    # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
    # This would have to be done by someone within Google, perhaps on the App Engine team or working in conjunction with them.
