# This page has the plan for getting Perl supported on Google AppEngine

= Introduction =

This is the current plan for how to get Perl supported on AppEngine.

= Details =

It seems like the major pieces of work would be:

  # a hardened perl
  # docs on hardened perl (what's turned off, what XS code is allowed, etc)
  # glueing in the hardened perl to App Engine
  # support the RPC wire format between trusted & untrusted worlds (the way you make API calls to do Datastore access, etc.)
  # Perl libraries for Datastore, URL Fetch, memcache, image manipulation, etc...
  # docs for those libraries

It seems like the community could do 1) and 2), using the same
restrictions as documented for Python on App Engine.  (no writing
files, no sockets, etc, etc...).  The hardened Perl would probably be
modified to not allow half the opcodes that Perl normally allows (see
Opcode.pm for a list), like "syscall", or select/poll/socket, etc.
And modified to _not_ allow dynamic loading of XS modules.  Only the
bare minimum of necessary XS modules would be permitted, and
statically linked.  (smaller footprint == less code to audit.)

Step 3) would probably need to be done by a Googler.  I have contacts
at Google (not on the AppEngine team) who would be interested in
helping out with this in their "20% time."

I would imagine that 4) would be open sourced soon enough, at which
point adding Perl support is trivial.  5) and 6) probably aren't hard
then, either.
