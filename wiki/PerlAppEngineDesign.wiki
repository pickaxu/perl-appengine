 * Google-AppEngine                    - the public interfaces (i.e. abstract base classes) of the Google API's
 * Google-AppEngine-Dev                - the web application container and api implementations for the development environment
 * Google-AppEngine-Google             - the web application container and api implementations for the Google App Engine environment
 * Google-AppEngine-Safe               - a distribution of Perl which is safe for running untrusted perl code in a shared cloud
 * Google-AppEngine-DevKit             - the development kit that includes the stand-alone web server
 * Bundle-Google-AppEngine-Google      - the packages included in the Google App Engine default installation

== Google-AppEngine ==
the public interfaces (i.e. abstract base classes) and the documentation of the Google API's
   # Write the public version of the Google API's (i.e. base classes that define the API which need to be subclassed in order to achieve the desired functionality)
         # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
         # The community could do this, without help from the Google App Engine team.

== Google-AppEngine-Dev ==
the web application container and api implementations for the development environment
   # Write the Development Kit "container" (i.e. the glue code which routes requests arriving at the web server to the perl interpreter and back.)
         # This would also include the low-level implementations of the public base classes which implement work-alike functionality to the Datastore, Mail, Images, Memcache, URL Fetch, and Users libraries provided by Google.
         # Writing this container would result in the recommended list of Perl modules to be included by default in the Google App Engine implementation along with the core Perl modules.
         # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
         # The community could do this, without help from the Google App Engine team.

== Google-AppEngine-Google ==
the web application container and api implementations for the Google App Engine environment
   # Write the Google App Engine "container" (i.e. the glue code which routes requests arriving at the web server to the perl interpreter and back.)
         # This would also include the low-level implementations of the public base classes
         # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
         # This would have to be done by someone within Google, perhaps on the App Engine team or working in conjunction with them.

== Google-AppEngine-Safe ==
a distribution of Perl which is safe for running untrusted perl code in a shared cloud
   # Make Perl "safe" for the App Engine cloud.
         # This might be done using Safe.pm so Perl can't do things that are not allowed in the cloud such as attempting to open a socket, write to a file, or do dynamic linking.
         # Code that performs these illegal actions must raise an error.
         # This might also include changes to the Perl build system to easily enable the creation of a suitable executable which links necessary XS modules statically and disallows dynamic linking. It might need to turn off certain support at compile time rather than depending on Safe.pm.
         # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
         # The community could do this, without help from the Google App Engine team.

== Google-AppEngine-DevKit ==
the development kit that includes the stand-alone web server
   # Write the Development Kit with a built-in web server
         # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
         # The community could do this, without help from the Google App Engine team.

== Bundle-Google-AppEngine-Google ==
the packages included in the Google App Engine default installation

   # Determine what would be the recommended list of Perl modules to be included by default in the Google App Engine implementation along with the core Perl modules.
         # Appropriate test cases and documentation should be written.
         # The community could do this, without help from the Google App Engine team.
