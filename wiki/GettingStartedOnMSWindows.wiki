#summary How to get started with installing and understanding the software on MS Windows

= Introduction =

First read the GettingStarted page for appropriate background information.

= Installation of Tools =

== Active Perl ==

If you don't have Perl for Windows, get it here and install it. (It is free of charge.)

  * http://www.activestate.com/store/activeperl/
  ** Click on "Download", skip the Contact Details and push "Continue"
  ** I would choose "Download ActivePerl 5.10.0.1003 for Windows (x86): MSI - 15.4MB" for my Windows XP laptop
  ** However, I have Perl 5.8.8 installed and I didn't actually bother to upgrade.
  ** Download the Windows installer file to some location, then run it to install.

and the documentation ...

  * http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/docs/ASPNTOC-APERL_5.10/

The rest of this document will assume that you install it in C:\Perl, the default location.

== Tortoise SVN ==

If you don't have a Subversion client, get TortoiseSVN here.

  * http://www.tortoisesvn.net/

Download the Windows installer file to some location, then run it to install.
The rest of this document will assume you have TortoiseSVN.

= Installing Required Perl Modules from CPAN =

Here's how to get started.
I had to install the following modules and their dependencies on my system.
(You may have to install more.)

First, go the Windows Command shell.

{{{
   ppm-shell
   ppm> install IPC::Run
   ppm> install Net::Server
   ppm> install namespace::clean
   ppm> exit
}}}
{{{
   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI
   cpan> install Moose
   cpan> install Moose::Policy
   cpan> exit
}}}

If you did install the module called Class::C3::XS,
it needs to be uninstalled. I did the following to get rid
of it. You may have to adjust your paths appropriately.

{{{
   su -   # become root
   rm /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i686-linux/Class/C3/XS.pm
   rm /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i686-linux/auto/Class/C3/XS/XS.bs
   rm /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i686-linux/auto/Class/C3/XS/XS.so
   rm /usr/share/man/man3/Class::C3::XS.3pm
   rm /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i686-linux/auto/Class/C3/XS/.packlist
   exit   # become a normal user again
}}}

Note: draegtun has suggested that setting the CLASS_MOP_NO_XS environment variable
would make the uninstall of Class::C3::XS unnecessary. I (spadkins) tried this
and was unable to make that work.

== Python 2.5 ==

If you don't have Python 2.5 installed, get it here.

  * http://www.python.org/

Download the Windows installer file to some location, then run it to install.
The rest of this document will assume you have TortoiseSVN.
