#summary How to get started with installing and understanding the software on MS Windows

= Introduction =

First read the GettingStarted page for appropriate background information.

= Installation of Tools =

== Active Perl ==

If you don't have Perl for Windows, get it here and install it. (It is free of charge.)

  * http://www.activestate.com/store/activeperl/
  ** Click on "Download", skip the Contact Details and push "Continue"
  ** I would choose "Download ActivePerl 5.10.0.1003 for Windows (x86): MSI - 15.4MB" for my Windows XP laptop
  ** However, I have Perl 5.8.8 installed and I didn't actually bother to upgrade.

If you don't have a Subversion client, get TortoiseSVN here.
