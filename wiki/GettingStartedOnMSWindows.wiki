#summary How to get started with installing and understanding the software on MS Windows

= Introduction =

First read the GettingStarted page for appropriate background information.

= Installation of Tools =

== Strawberry Perl ==

I used Strawberry Perl rather than Active Perl because it includes a compiler.
If you don't have Perl for Windows, get it here and install it. (It is free of charge.)

  * http://strawberryperl.com/
  ** Download the Windows installer file to some location, then run it to install.

See also

  * http://win32.perl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Strawberry_Perl

The rest of this document will assume that you install it in C:\strawberry, the default location.

NOTE: If you already had Active State Perl installed, then C:\Perl\bin (Active State) might be before C:\strawberry\perl\bin in the PATH. If so, go to Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables->System Variables->Path and remove "C:\Perl\bin".

== Tortoise SVN ==

If you don't have a Subversion client, get TortoiseSVN here.

  * http://www.tortoisesvn.net/

Download the Windows installer file to some location, then run it to install.
The rest of this document will assume you have TortoiseSVN.

= Installing Required Perl Modules from CPAN =

Here's how to get started.
I had to install the following modules and their dependencies on my system.
(You may have to install more.)

First, go the Windows Command shell.

{{{
   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install Net::Server
   cpan> install namespace::clean
   cpan> install Moose
   cpan> install Moose::Policy
   cpan> exit

   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install IPC::Run
   cpan> force install IPC::Run
   cpan> install HTTP::Server::Simple
   cpan> exit

   cd \strawberry\cpan\build
   dir
   cd IPC-Run-0.80-nUzol5
   dmake install
   cd ..
   dir
   cd HTTP-Server-Simple-0.34-OkyRHT
   dmake install
   cd ..
}}}

Notes:
  * The first set of installs should go cleanly
  * The test for IPC::Run hung up and then failed on Windows. I used "force" to get it to install. If that doesn't work for you, do the commands under the "build" directory as described.
  * The test for HTTP::Server::Simple hung up forever on Windows. I had to kill it. I tried using "force" but it did no good. I resorted to using the commands under the "build" directory as described.
  * The CPAN shell downloads and unpacks the distributions under C:\strawberry\cpan\build. However, the directory names have six random characters at the end to make them unique. Your directory names will not be the same as I show here. Do the "dir" to find out what your directory names are, and do the "dmake install" in the appropriate directory.
  * I was not given a chance to avoid installing Class::C3::XS, but it appears not to have been installed, so I didn't have to uninstall it.

== Python 2.5 ==

If you don't have Python 2.5 installed, get it here.

  * http://www.python.org/

Download the Windows installer file to some location, then run it to install.
The rest of this document will assume you have TortoiseSVN.
