#summary How to get started with installing and understanding the software on MS Windows

= Introduction =

First read the GettingStarted page for appropriate background information.

= Installation of Tools =

== Active Perl ==

If you don't have Perl for Windows, get it here and install it. (It is free of charge.)

  * http://www.activestate.com/store/activeperl/
  ** Click on "Download", skip the Contact Details and push "Continue"
  ** I would choose "Download ActivePerl 5.10.0.1003 for Windows (x86): MSI - 15.4MB" for my Windows XP laptop
  ** However, I have Perl 5.8.8 installed and I didn't actually bother to upgrade.

See also

  * http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/index.mhtml
  * http://www.activestate.com/Products/languages.mhtml
  * http://www.activestate.com/index.mhtml

and the documentation ...

  * http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/docs/ASPNTOC-APERL_5.10/

The rest of this document will assume that you install it in C:\Perl, the default location.

== Tortoise SVN ==

If you don't have a Subversion client, get TortoiseSVN here.

  * http://www.tortoisesvn.net/

The rest of this document will assume you have TortoiseSVN.

*IMPORTANT* I am converting this document from the original GettingStarted, and 
the rest is *not* complete.
------------------------------------------

= Installation and Updating of Perl App Engine =

Here's how to get started.
I had to install the following modules and their dependencies on my system.
(You may have to install more.)

IMPORTANT: When you install Moose (below) and follow the dependencies, you will
be prompted to install Class::C3::XS. This is the one default you should
*not* choose (i.e. choose "No").  If you miss this, you will need to
uninstall it later.

{{{
   su -   # become root
   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install IPC::Run
   cpan> install HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI
   cpan> install Net::Server::Fork
   cpan> install namespace::clean
   cpan> install Moose
   cpan> install Moose::Policy
   cpan> exit
   exit   # become a normal user again
}}}

If you did install the module called Class::C3::XS,
it needs to be uninstalled. I did the following to get rid
of it. You may have to adjust your paths appropriately.

{{{
   su -   # become root
   rm /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i686-linux/Class/C3/XS.pm
   rm /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i686-linux/auto/Class/C3/XS/XS.bs
   rm /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i686-linux/auto/Class/C3/XS/XS.so
   rm /usr/share/man/man3/Class::C3::XS.3pm
   rm /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/i686-linux/auto/Class/C3/XS/.packlist
   exit   # become a normal user again
}}}

Note: draegtun has suggested that setting the CLASS_MOP_NO_XS environment variable
would make the uninstall of Class::C3::XS unnecessary. I (spadkins) tried this
and was unable to make that work.

Then you check out the existing projects.
(I am assuming you will do this in a HOME directory on a Linux system.)

{{{
   cd $HOME/src
   svn checkout http://sys-protect.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/     sys-protect
   svn checkout http://protobuf-perl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/   protobuf-perl
   svn checkout http://perl-appengine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/  perl-appengine
}}}

Then do the initial compilation. (Do this once.)
Note: These do not need to be installed via "make install" as the
perl-appengine dev kit includes relative paths to the appropriate directories.

{{{
   cd $HOME/src/sys-protect
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
}}}

Then do the following to update and compile. (Do this regularly to
keep up to date.)

{{{
   cd $HOME/src/sys-protect
   svn update
   perl Makefile.PL
   make

   cd $HOME/src/protobuf-perl
   svn update

   cd $HOME/src/perl-appengine
   svn update
}}}

= Running the Development Server =

The code currently checked in to the perl-appengine subversion repository is
targeted to be the development kit. To demonstrate what it can currently do,
type the following.

{{{
   cd $HOME/src/perl-appengine
   dev_appserver.pl demos/prototest
}}}

The server output was as follows.

{{{
 2008/07/28-22:52:38 AppEngine::Server::NetServer0 (type Net::Server::Fork) starting! pid(14736)
 Binding to TCP port 9000 on host *
 Group Not Defined.  Defaulting to EGID '205 3000 217 10 205'
 User Not Defined.  Defaulting to EUID '102'
}}}

Then I went to lynx to access the test page.

{{{
   lynx localhost:9000
}}}

To have more useful demo working (such as a guestbook), you need to run the python development server so our api proxy has something to proxy the requests to:

{{{
    ./python_sdk_partial/dev_appserver.py apiproxy_python &
    perl dev_appserver.pl demos/guestbook
}}}
